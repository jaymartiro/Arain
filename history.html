            <p>CEBU CITY, Philippines – Florencio ‘Entoy’ Escabas who was featured on
                 Netflix for his popular bakasi (stewed reef-eel) died on June 15. He was 72. 
                 Mang Entoy was rushed to the hospital after experiencing chest pains.
                  He was already diagnosed with high-blood pressure and heart enlargement
                   but took medication for these illnesses.

            <p>Mang Entoy, more than anything, was a father and grandfather who brought laughter and love to his family.
                Tura said that even during the coronavirus pandemic, customers would ask them to cook some reef-eels 
                and they would willingly pay for delivery just to get a taste of this local favorite.
